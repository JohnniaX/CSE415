1) Tic tac toe has 24 distinct states after 5 moves have been made.
2) An expression to represent the number of distinct states that can be achieved after 6 moves is the number of spots left * number of spots left - 1 * … * number of spots left - 5. In this case, that is 21 * 20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16 which equals 39070080.
