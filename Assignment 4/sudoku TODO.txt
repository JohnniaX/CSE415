TODO:
X    Implement a deep equals method
X    Provide a print out of the board
X    Create a hash code
X    Copy the state
X    Check if the number can be placed there
X        Check inside the subgrid
X        Check along the row
X        Check along the column
X    Actually place the number
X    Create a goal test: E.g. all spots are filled
X    Have the operator class
    Create an initial state
    Create all of the operators, should be 729, 81 blocks with 9 possibilites per each block
        However we can elimate operators for blocks that are already filled in, drastically reducing the number of operators (9 per block removed)
